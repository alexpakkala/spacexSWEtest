**SpaceX C++ Software Engineer Coding Assessment - Starlink Beam Planner**

This is my solution to SpaceX's coding assessment for the C++ Software Engineer role. This was an entry-level postion. I had the option ot use C++ or Python. My solution passed all tests. Submissions were considered passing if they pass all tests and were submitted within 4 hours of starting, but it was emphasised to me that it should take 2 hours or less to finish. Results were submitted automatically by running 'make', which was pretty neat.
